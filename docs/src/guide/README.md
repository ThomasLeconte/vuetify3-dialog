# Introduction

Veutify3 Dialogs is a plugin for Vue3 and Vuetify3 that provides a simple way to create dialogs, snackbars and bottom sheets programatically. When creating one of these components, an anwser is delivered by a promise, telling you if the dialog was accepted or rejected for example, or when a snackbar is dismissed. This plugin is inspired by the [Vuetify Dialog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuetify-dialog) plugin for Vue2 and Vuetify2.

<!-- VuePress is composed of two parts: a [minimalistic static site generator](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/tree/master/packages/%40vuepress/core) with a Vue-powered [theming system](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/) and [Plugin API](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/), and a [default theme](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html) optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of Vue's own sub projects.

Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site. -->
